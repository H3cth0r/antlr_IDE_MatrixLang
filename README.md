# antlr_IDE_MatrixLang
This is the code of an ANTLR parser for a grammar of a languaje for matrix operations.
This is a very simple grammar. For this project it was requested for us to create am IDE
for creating and editing this grammar. For this it was necessary to translate our code to another programming languaje that can execute the program; on this case, the languaje to which the current project translates to, is CPP. 

## Requierement
In this case, we are running the project on windows machines. We are using Java 17 SDK and python 3.10 verssion; so we invite you to use this same configuration for making the porject run smoothly.



## ANTLR setup
For setting the antlr module on out system and Intellij IDE, we followed the next tutorial that applys an small example:

## Py4J python library
As we are running the IDE on python popular GUI creation Tinkr, we made use of some python module that let us connect or use some Java class or object from a running JMV, so you must install and setup the python library on your project our IDE. This technology is very similar to java RMI lib. For installing this lib, you may go to the officila Py4J documentation site, where all py4y topics are explained on a very clcear way. 

## Compile and Run
For doing this step you must firstly setup antlr, then you may do this part. For staingÂ¡ing antlr, you must
